Switch/case control structure for templates
-------------------------------------------

With EEs if/else conditionals, each condition is parsed before  being removed at the end of the parsing process. This means if you wrap if/else tags around lots of other tags then your template will be running many unnecessary queries and functions.

As Switchee is a tag we can use parse=“inward” to ensure that unmatched conditions are not parsed before being removed from the template.

* Allows multiple case values separated by pipe ‘|’.
* Supports regular expression matching like so: #regex#
* Multiple regular expressions separated by | can be used for one case value
* Supports empty string matches represesnted by ‘’ or “”
