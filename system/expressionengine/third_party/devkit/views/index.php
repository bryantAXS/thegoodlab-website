<p><h3>A note about the load snippets/globals from disk feature ..</h3></p>
<p>For this to work you need to have setup <em>"Allow Templates to be Saved as Files?"</em> and specified a basepath <a href='<?=$_base."D=cp&C=design&M=global_template_preferences"?>'>here (link)</a>. Then, start saving your snippets in a folder called "snippets" in your template directory, and your global variables in a folder called "global_variables" in your template directory. Do not give these files any endings (so a snippet named "global_footer" will be populated from the <em>snippets/global_footer</em> file. Also, know that when you click the "Load snippets/globals from disk" button all snippets/global variables will be imported from disk. If a snippet/global var exists by the same name, it will be overwritten (that is, updated). It's meant for you, the effective developer, not your clients ;).</p>
